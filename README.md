# NLP-Hugging-Face-Transformer-Pipelines

There are three main steps involved when you pass some text to a pipeline:

The text is preprocessed into a format the model can understand.
The preprocessed inputs are passed to the model.
The predictions of the model are post-processed, so you can make sense of them.
Some of the currently available pipelines are:

- feature-extraction (get the vector representation of a text)
- fill-mask
- ner (named entity recognition)
- question-answering
- sentiment-analysis
- summarization
- text-generation
- translation
- zero-shot-classification
