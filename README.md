# NLP-Hugging-Face-Transformer-Pipelines

There are three main steps involved when you pass some text to a pipeline:

* The text is preprocessed into a format the model can understand.
* The preprocessed inputs are passed to the model.
* The predictions of the model are post-processed, so you can make sense of them.

Here I explore the various tasks the hugging face pipelines are capable of:

- feature-extraction (get the vector representation of a text)
- fill-mask
- ner (named entity recognition)
- question-answering
- sentiment-analysis
- summarization
- text-generation
- translation
- zero-shot-classification
